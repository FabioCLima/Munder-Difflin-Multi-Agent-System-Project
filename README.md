# Munder Difflin Multi-Agent System Project

Welcome to the **Munder Difflin Paper Company Multi-Agent System Project**! This repository contains a complete implementation of a multi-agent system that supports core business operations at a fictional paper manufacturing company.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system using **Pydantic-AI** framework to automate:

- **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock monitoring and low-stock alerts
- **Quote Generation**: Intelligent pricing with bulk discounts and historical data
- **Sales Processing**: Order fulfillment with automatic inventory updates
- **Reordering**: Automated supplier orders when stock levels drop below minimum
- **Orchestration**: Central coordination of all business processes

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of **5 specialized agents**:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator that routes customer requests to appropriate agents
2. **Inventory Agent**: Manages stock levels, product search, and availability checks
3. **Quoting Agent**: Generates price quotes with bulk discounts and historical pricing
4. **Sales Agent**: Processes orders, handles transactions, and manages financial reports
5. **Reordering Agent**: Monitors stock levels and places supplier orders automatically

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Munder-Difflin-Multi-Agent-System-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using UV**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   Or using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

### Running the System

1. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   uv run python src/project_starter.py
   ```

2. **Run the evaluation**:
   ```bash
   uv run python run_evaluation.py
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/
   ```

## 🔧 Key Features

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Intelligent Routing**: Orchestrator automatically routes requests to appropriate agents
- **Context Sharing**: Agents share database context and current date for consistency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Business Logic
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Bulk discounts based on order size (2% to 15%)
- **Stock Management**: Real-time inventory tracking with automatic reordering
- **Financial Tracking**: Complete transaction history and financial reporting
- **Supplier Integration**: Automated supplier orders with delivery scheduling

### Data Management
- **SQLite Database**: Persistent storage for inventory, transactions, and quotes
- **Historical Analysis**: Quote history for pricing consistency
- **Financial Reports**: Comprehensive business analytics
